# HealthBase - Patient Data Management System

The healthcare sector constantly evolves with technological advancements, and one critical aspect is patient record management.Traditional paper-based systems are inefficient, leading to errors, data loss, and collaboration challenges.

One critical challenge in this landscape is the effective management of patient records, particularly in large healthcare facilities that handle thousands of patients daily. To address this issue, we propose a cloud-based patient record management system designed to facilitate efficient and secure handling of patient information.

This innovative system leverages cloud computing technology, enabling healthcare providers to access patient records in real- time from any location with internet access. Advanced security features ensure that patient data remains protected from unauthorized access and breaches. Ultimately, this project aims to design and implement a reliable cloud-based solution that enhances the quality of care, improves patient outcomes, and reduces costs within the healthcare industry.
